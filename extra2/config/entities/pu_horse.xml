<!-- 
    THIS IS AN EARLY, NON-FINAL VERSION.  PLEASE HEED THE COMMENTS IN THIS FILE! 
    Try to keep the comments - if you delete them, other people may not easily 
    understand the meaning of some of the tags used herein.
    
    29.12.2003:  
      Please note that there has been another change:  Entities that
    support the walk command (GGL::CBehaviorWalkCommand) now require the tag
    <MoveTaskList>TL_WhatEver</MoveTaskList>
    in their EGL::CMovementBehaviorProps (sic: there are no extended props for
    the walk command behavior).
      And another thing:  there is now also a GGL::CBattleBehavior with
    the props class GGL::CBattleBehaviorProps.  These define the damage class and
    damage amount of the entity.  (Note that the armor class and amount are in the
    settler props and the armor class is specified by a number currently.)
      Also in the battle behavior props are various task list and animation 
    properties.  Please refer to the comments below.
      Furthermore, for settlers a dodge chance can be specified, but it is not 
    currently used in the battle mechanics.  But it will be.
